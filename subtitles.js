00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,969
Let's jump right into lesson one with an example.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,090
Let's say you have a big exam tomorrow and

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,850
your memory needs to be as sharp as possible.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,200
What would you do to prepare? Well, let's say I

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,095
asked this question to a bunch of people and

6
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:16,540
42% said they would get a good workout the

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,830
night before, 28% said they would eat a good

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,370
dinner. 16% said they would stay up studying. 13% said

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,410
they'd get a good night's sleep. And the remaining 1% said something

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:34,830
else. Would you believe these survey results? Before deciding whether or not you

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,520
would, what would you want to know? How many people I surveyed, who

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,530
I surveyed, or maybe, how the survey was conducted. Check all that apply.

1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,450
You would want to know all of these since they all influence the validity of

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,460
our results. A good sample size, a representative

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,730
sample and a sound methodology are all really

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,630
important in a good research study. When you

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,870
read and analyze research, you should always be

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,010
aware of these factors. That way, you can

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,010
make good decisions based off of valid research.

3 - Measure Memory - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,467
Let's assume that to get a good grade, we need a good memory. That means that we

2
00:00:05,479 --> 00:00:10,909
have to do everything we can to boost our memory. Therefore, we might look at a

3
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:16,563
bunch of different factors that influence memory. If we're doing a real research

4
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:21,983
study, we want to make sure that these factors really do positively influence

5
00:00:21,995 --> 00:00:27,835
memory. But we can't analyze the relationship between these and memory without

6
00:00:27,847 --> 00:00:33,595
having a clear definition and way of measuring memory. So, how would you measure

7
00:00:33,607 --> 00:00:39,005
memory? There is no right or wrong answer. The purpose of this is just to get

8
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:39,935
you thinking.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,797
&gt;&gt; How would you define happiness? &gt;&gt; Being at peace. &gt;&gt; The ability to , I

2
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:15,464
guess live a fulfilled life. &gt;&gt; It's more what you feel. What you can bring to

3
00:00:15,476 --> 00:00:20,093
others and not so much what you see. &gt;&gt; They kind of bounce. Their eyes get all

4
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:24,273
happy. Their ears kind of go up. They get all loose, like their body language is

5
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:28,959
real loose. and yeah, their tails wag, like he's happy right now. &gt;&gt; How would

6
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:33,119
you measure it? &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know, I, I don't measure nothin' really. I just

7
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:33,119
&gt;&gt; I'm happy.

8
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,765
&gt;&gt; I think I'd probably measure it by the number of times I smile every day. &gt;&gt;

9
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:43,105
I have no idea. I'd have to think about that for a sec. &gt;&gt; Their, their

10
00:00:43,117 --> 00:00:47,460
attitude. Their, just the way they are personally. &gt;&gt; If I was a researcher and

11
00:00:47,472 --> 00:00:52,202
I wanted to know how well you remembered something how could I do that? &gt;&gt; If

12
00:00:52,214 --> 00:00:57,683
you're talking about like say, scientific experimentation. To have a control of

13
00:00:57,695 --> 00:01:03,165
some sort, you could film the experience that a person has and then interview

14
00:01:03,177 --> 00:01:08,449
that person. maybe have multiple people to interview, so you get different

15
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:13,931
points of view for the same event. And see how that differs. &gt;&gt; How would you

16
00:01:13,943 --> 00:01:21,240
define memory? &gt;&gt;, &gt;&gt; It's an accumulation of information, data. far more

17
00:01:21,252 --> 00:01:27,805
important is how you apply that, how you use it? &gt;&gt; The ability to retrieve

18
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:34,954
information from your past. &gt;&gt; I have to think about it. &gt;&gt; Things I bothered to

19
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:37,755
remember for &gt;&gt; Later use.

20
00:01:37,755 --> 00:01:44,312
&gt;&gt; How would you define itchiness? &gt;&gt; Discomfort, yeah just general discomfort.

21
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:51,297
&gt;&gt; Something that's irritating you, and you have to scratch it. &gt;&gt; The intensity

22
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:57,437
of the itch would match the time length of scratching. &gt;&gt; With the amount that

23
00:01:57,449 --> 00:02:02,087
they move around. &gt;&gt; You could ask a very forward question, like is there

24
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:04,996
something you need me to scratch? Right now.

25
00:02:04,996 --> 00:02:09,684
&gt;&gt; Well that sounds a little personal. &gt;&gt; Very close friend, maybe you could do

26
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:14,067
that. &gt;&gt; So kind of like happin ess if you had to measure how itchy your dog was

27
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:18,511
right now, how would you do that? &gt;&gt; How would you quantify it? &gt;&gt; I'm going to

28
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:22,887
I'd, I'd definitely go with, like, how often they were scratching, or how often

29
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:27,466
they were doing sort of a full body shake. &gt;&gt; How would you measure stress? &gt;&gt; I

30
00:02:27,478 --> 00:02:31,351
think you could measure stress by, obviously, there's, I'm sure medical ways

31
00:02:31,363 --> 00:02:35,656
that you could measure stress. &gt;&gt; Yeah, the frown on my face, on my, on my mouth

32
00:02:35,668 --> 00:02:37,609
I mean. &gt;&gt; Heartbeats probably.

33
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,059

5 - BBC Memory Test - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,760
Clearly, there isn't just one way to measure things like memory, happiness,

2
00:00:04,867 --> 00:00:09,920
guilt, love, and these are called constructs. It's very difficult sometimes to

3
00:00:09,932 --> 00:00:14,850
define and measure them, and so there are a lot of different ways that we can do

4
00:00:14,862 --> 00:00:19,545
that. BBC came up with one way of measuring memory by creating a test on how

5
00:00:19,557 --> 00:00:25,078
well you can remember faces. Click the link at the right, called BBC Face Memory

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,809
Test, to do this memory test. Remember, your scores and write them down. And

7
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:34,778
again, this isn't graded. We're just going to do this because this is a formal

8
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,058
way of measuring and testing memory.

6 - BBC Scores - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,533
Great, so you should have gotten both a recognition score and a temporal memory

2
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:09,104
score. The recognition score measures how well you recognize faces that you saw

3
00:00:09,116 --> 00:00:13,675
before and the temporal memory score measures how well you remember when you saw

4
00:00:13,687 --> 00:00:18,315
each face. We're going to use your data to analyze the construct memory. Click

5
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:22,906
the link at the right called BBC Scores to enter your scores from the memory

6
00:00:22,918 --> 00:00:27,522
test. And don't worry, we don't really care what your scores are and we still

7
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:32,256
think you're awesome. If you got 68%, for example, just type 68. You'll also

8
00:00:32,268 --> 00:00:36,965
notice that we ask how long you slept last night. So please enter that as well.

8 - BBC Measurement - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,555
So now, we're going to take a quiz. And this is a little tricky. But, of course,

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,332
the whole point is to help you out and get you thinking about measurement. So,

3
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:13,830
how did BBC measure memory? Note that we're not asking about factors that

4
00:00:13,842 --> 00:00:18,575
contributed to your score, we're asking specifically how did BBC precisely

5
00:00:18,587 --> 00:00:19,881
measure memory.

6
00:00:19,885 --> 00:00:24,294
Was it that types of faces you remember? The percent of faces correctly

7
00:00:24,306 --> 00:00:29,248
recognized and placed from parts 1 and 2? Knowing whether you saw the face first

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,089
or second? Knowing whether or not the face was there? Or the number of faces you

9
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:34,666
remember.

`;
var srt009= `
9 - BBC Measurement Solution - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,271
So the correct answer is this one. The percent of faces correctly recognized and

2
00:00:06,283 --> 00:00:12,290
placed from parts I and II. So this is very precise, the percent of faces. The

3
00:00:12,302 --> 00:00:18,561
others contribute to your score so if you remember specific types of faces, that

4
00:00:18,573 --> 00:00:24,426
helps you to get a higher percentage. Or knowing whether you saw the face first

5
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:29,695
or second? That also helps you get a better score, but that's not how it was

6
00:00:29,707 --> 00:00:35,230
measured. Knowing whether or not the face was there? Yes, that contributes to

7
00:00:35,242 --> 00:00:40,736
your score. And the tricky one, the number of faces you remember. If the score

8
00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:46,323
were given to you as a number For example, you remembered, I dunno 11 out of 12,

9
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:51,504
that would be the way that BBC measured it but your score at the end was a

10
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:56,503
percent. So this is how they measure memory. And it's important to be very

11
00:00:56,515 --> 00:01:01,962
precise. And if you got that wrong, don't worry. This was a tricky question and

12
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:04,433
it's more just to get you thinking.

10 - Operational Definition - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,147
Now, when we pick a way of measuring it,
we also kind of have an operational

2
00:00:05,159 --> 00:00:10,629
definition. So in the BBC study, the
operational definition of a good memory is

3
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:16,138
when the percentage of faces correctly
recognized and placed is higher. So once

4
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:21,474
we have an operational definition, we're
able to measure constructs in the real

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,683
everyone might have their own definition and way of measuring it. So now, we're

3
00:00:09,695 --> 00:00:14,342
going to take a quiz to see how well you understand constructs. Choose all that

4
00:00:14,354 --> 00:00:15,870

12 - Constructs Solution - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,036
Gallons of gasoline is not a construct, because we already have a way of

2
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:10,388
measuring it in gallons. Intelligence is a construct. How do we measure and

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,135
define intelligence? We have the IQ test, or maybe we could measure intelligence

4
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:21,645
with grades. But grades may also help us measure something like how hard we're

5
00:00:21,657 --> 00:00:27,987
working. Like effort. Effort is a construct. We might measure effort by how many

6
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:33,516
minutes we spend working on homework or by grades, or GPA. Age is also a

7
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:39,535
construct. If I had put age in years, I would have defined age as the number of

8
00:00:39,547 --> 00:00:45,366
years you've been living but some people might look at age as how mature you

9
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:46,258
are.

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,907
Here I didn't put a way of measuring it, and age therefore is kind of tricky,

11
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:56,029
would be considered a construct in this case. So maturity, age in years, and

12
00:00:56,041 --> 00:01:01,124
wisdom are all three different ways you could possibly measure age. Hunger is

13
00:01:01,136 --> 00:01:06,515
also a construct. Hunger could be measured by how often your tummy grumbles or

14
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:12,790
by how deficient in nutrients your body is. Annual salary in US dollars, is not

15
00:01:12,802 --> 00:01:19,090
a construct. That's because we put in US dollars. And therefore we have a way of

16
00:01:19,102 --> 00:01:25,338
measuring your annual salary. And finally itchiness is a construct. How would

17
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,160
you define and measure itchiness? I'll let you ponder that one yourself. We have

18
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:34,973
to think carefully about how to define and measure constructs. The descriptions

19
00:01:34,985 --> 00:01:39,688
for constructs that we settle on, and that allow us to measure them, are called

20
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,347
our operational definition.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:10,404
these aren't necessarily the operational definitions for each of these

14 - Operational Definitions Solution - lang_en_vs5.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,879
Good job trying to match each construct with each operational definition. For

2
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:09,852
depression, someone's score on the Beck's Depression Inventory, could be a way

3
00:00:09,864 --> 00:00:14,781
of measuring and defining depression. For hunger, grams of food consumed. For

4
00:00:14,793 --> 00:00:19,831
stress, levels of cortisol, which is the stress hormone. For anger, this could

5
00:00:19,843 --> 00:00:24,692
either be number of profanities uttered per minute or even ratio of minutes

6
00:00:24,704 --> 00:00:29,722
spent smiling to minutes not smiling. The difference is that ratio of minutes

7
00:00:29,734 --> 00:00:34,583
spent smiling to minutes not smiling would be a better measure of happiness.

8
00:00:34,692 --> 00:00:39,985
Because if it's greater than one then you're spending more time smiling. So the

9
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:44,698
higher this ratio, the happier you would be. So this would be a better measure

10
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,562
of happiness. So for anger, a better operational definition would be the number

11
00:00:49,574 --> 00:00:54,418
of profanities uttered per minute. Some operational definitions aren't so good,

12
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:59,737
but this is just an example. Health, could be resting heart rate. Obesity, body

00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:05,046
mass index. Effort, minutes spent studying for an exam. And brand loyalty, the

14
00:01:05,058 --> 00:01:10,305
number of products purchased per year from a particular brand. So these are all

15
00:01:10,317 --> 00:01:15,736
operational definitions which allow you to measure each of these constructs. And

16
00:01:15,748 --> 00:01:19,254
after being able to measure these constructs, we can analyze them.

15 - Data - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,938
Data is the most essential part of statistics. Without data we couldn't do

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,926
anything. So now we have data on how many hours you slept, your recognition

3
00:00:09,938 --> 00:00:14,988
score and your temporal memory score, and we have data values for each one of

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,570
you who entered these scores. So the first person slept 7 hours, got a 91%

5
00:00:20,582 --> 00:00:26,922
recognition score and an 86% temporal memory score. So this row of data is for

6
00:00:26,934 --> 00:00:33,112
one person. The next person got 6.5 hours of sleep, a 95% recognition score and

7
00:00:33,112 --> 00:00:38,708
a 78 percent temporal memory score. And remember, that you can see this actual

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,366
data if you click on the BBC results link. Anyway, so we have columns of data,

9
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:50,226
and each row corresponds to one person. Hours slept, recognition score, and

10
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:55,457
temporal memory score are called variables, because they vary across

11
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,703
individuals. So now we're returning to the question. You have an exam tomorrow.

12
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:04,378

What if we looked at our data and noticed that everyone who got less than six

2
00:00:05,062 --> 00:00:10,400
hours of sleep also got a temporal memory score less than 70%. And that everyone

3
00:00:10,412 --> 00:00:15,725
who got greater than six hours of sleep got a temporal memory score greater than

4
00:00:15,737 --> 00:00:20,097
70%. So that would mean their scores are either here Or here.

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,598
Which of the following conclusions is the most likely? The less sleep you have,

6
00:00:25,714 --> 00:00:31,341
the better your memory, the more sleep you have, the better your memory, people

7
00:00:31,353 --> 00:00:36,639
always get the same memory score no matter how long you slept, or there's no

17 - Sleep and Memory Solution - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,650
The answer, if this were true, is that the more you sleep, the better your

2
00:00:04,662 --> 00:00:09,435
memory. People who didn't sleep for very long got lower scores. People that

3
00:00:09,447 --> 00:00:14,320
slept for longer, more than 6 hours, got better scores. So, if all the data

4
00:00:14,332 --> 00:00:19,455
followed this pattern, we could reasonably conclude that the more you sleep, the

5
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:20,662
better your memory tends to be.

Besides sleep, other things influence memory. This is supposed to be a brain.

2
00:00:04,702 --> 00:00:09,430
So, what else do you think could have influenced your memory? The time of day at

3
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:13,881
which you took the test, the number of palm trees in Hawaii, whether or not

4
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:18,216
you're stressed, the price of milk, whether or not you took the five-minute

5
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:24,721
breaks that the test recommended, the mass of Pluto, your age and finally, not

6
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:30,162
paying attention when the phases are shown. Check all that apply.

var srt019= `
19 - Influence Memory Solution - lang_en_vs5.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,885
So definitely, the time of day that you took the test could have influenced your

2
00:00:03,897 --> 00:00:07,712
memory. If you're taking the test late at night, you might be really tired, or

3
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:11,431
maybe your brain just doesn't work in the morning, like one of my friends. He

4
00:00:11,443 --> 00:00:15,125
can't think at all in the morning. That isn't to say that it definitely did

5
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:18,927
influence your memory, but it could have. The number of palm trees in Hawaii

6
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:22,980
isn't very plausible to have influenced your memory. Your stress level

7
00:00:22,992 --> 00:00:28,133
definitely could have influenced your memory. If you're really stressed, maybe

8
00:00:28,145 --> 00:00:33,269
you don't remember as well. The price of milk, not so plausible. The five minute

9
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:38,380
breaks? Absolutely. If you didn't take the five minute breaks, my hunch is that

10
00:00:38,392 --> 00:00:43,930
it might be more difficult to remember which face was from part 1 or part 2. The

11
00:00:43,942 --> 00:00:50,055
Mass of Pluto, not so much. Your age? Definitely. And finally, not paying

12
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:56,460
attention, definitely could have influenced your memory. And the BBC study

13
00:00:56,472 --> 00:01:01,945
concluded that age and time of day were the two biggest influencers on how well

14
00:01:01,957 --> 00:01:06,658
people performed on this memory test, if you didn't get a chance to see the BBC

15
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,321
test results. So, we're looking at a bunch of different things that could have

16
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:15,800
influenced your memory, including sleep. We make hypotheses all the time,

17
00:01:15,904 --> 00:01:16,252
everyday.

var srt020= `
20 - Control for Time of Day - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,689
So as a reminder, we are specifically concerned about whether or not sleep

2
00:00:04,702 --> 00:00:09,610
influences memory. But we've identified all these other variables that could

3
00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:14,540
influence memory. Now it's time for a quiz. So, would you trust this data more

4
00:00:14,622 --> 00:00:19,445
If you knew that everyone had taken this test at the same time of day, meaning

5
00:00:19,457 --> 00:00:24,160
the same time of day for everyone's respective time zones. So, for example,

6
00:00:24,267 --> 00:00:29,205
someone in India took it at 5 o'clock their time, same as someone in California

7
00:00:29,217 --> 00:00:32,025
who took it at 5 o'clock their time. Yes or no?

var srt021= `
21 - Control for Time of Day Solution - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,955
Yes, we would trust the results more because we're holding one of these factors

2
00:00:04,968 --> 00:00:09,955
constant. When more factors are held constant, the test is more reliable because

3
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:14,682
these conditions are the same for all people that took the test. We always have

4
00:00:14,693 --> 00:00:19,452
to think about extraneous factors, things that can impact the outcome that we

5
00:00:19,464 --> 00:00:24,537
may not have thought about. These extraneous factors can impact the outcome, in

6
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:29,264
this case, our memory. These extraneous factors are often called lurking

7
00:00:29,276 --> 00:00:34,229
variables. They just lurk around waiting to ambush your results. It's really

8
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:39,453
difficult to account for every possible extraneous factor. But this is something

9
00:00:39,465 --> 00:00:44,138
to be aware of, not only as you're going through this course, but when you

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,205
analyze data in your daily lives.

2
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:09,701
the average recognition score of everyone they studied was 92%, and the average

3
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:14,606

this class will be exactly the same as these averages? Yes or no?

23 - Same Scores Solution - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,251
Now, the answer is no. Within the population of everyone who took the BBC test,

2
00:00:05,365 --> 00:00:10,731
you guys are a sample. There are a lot of different samples we could take of all

3
00:00:10,743 --> 00:00:16,109
the people that took the test. We can take big samples, and small samples. And,

4
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:21,002
while your sample could get the same averages as those from the entire

5
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:26,553
population. There will also be samples that don't have the same averages. The

6
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:31,935
average memory score of the population is called the population parameter and

7
00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:37,211
it's denoted by mu. It's a funny little Greek symbol. And the average for the

8
00:00:37,223 --> 00:00:42,429
sample is called a sample statistic and we generally denote it by x bar. An x

9
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:47,380
with a bar on top. Now, I want to stress, please don't be nervous about symbols.

10
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,160
I know a lot of people get pretty nervous when they see symbols that they

11
00:00:52,172 --> 00:00:57,328
haven't seen before. But in mathematics, we really need symbols to illustrate

12
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,571
our points. Think of it like, when you're playing a musical instrument, and you

13
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:04,310
have sheep Sheet music.

14
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:09,300
How else are we going to make sure that people in future generations learn these

15
00:01:09,312 --> 00:01:14,160
classical melodies? Sheet music is the best way to do that. And same with, in

16
00:01:14,172 --> 00:01:19,085
mathematics when we use symbols. We need to be able to articulate are thoughts

17
00:01:19,097 --> 00:01:24,010
to other people all around the world. And that's one things that's really cool

18
00:01:24,022 --> 00:01:29,421
about mathematics it's a universal language. So don't worry, you'll soon become

19
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:34,457
familiar with these symbols because we're going to use them throughout this

20
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:39,444
course. Now we can use this sample statistic to approximate the population

21
00:01:39,456 --> 00:01:44,925
parameter. But generally, they won't be exactly the same. The difference between

22
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:50,261
these two is called the sampling error. Which means we can make educates guesses

23
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:55,519
about population parameters using sample statistics, but we probably won't be

24
00:01:55,531 --> 00:02:00,704
100% accurate. That's why it's really important to have a good sample that can

25
00:02:00,716 --> 00:02:05,914
better predict the population parameter. So going back the quiz, no. We don't

26
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:11,014
think that the average scores for this class will be exactly the same. But it

27
00:02:11,026 --> 00:02:13,673
will probably come close, and we're going to be able to see that later.

24 - Sample Average - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,810
So, we are going to spend a little more time with population parameters and

2
00:00:04,822 --> 00:00:09,690
samples statistics. Let's say that we have these memory scores. And, what if I

3
00:00:09,702 --> 00:00:14,685
pick the sample from this population that consisted of these scores. Now, just a

4
00:00:14,697 --> 00:00:19,630
point of clarification, populations are generally much bigger than this. But

5
00:00:19,642 --> 00:00:24,250
we're just going to pretend that this is the population, and we are choosing

6
00:00:24,262 --> 00:00:29,169
these three scores for a sample. Will the average of the sample be greater than,

7
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:33,216
equal to, or less than the population average? What do you think?

var srt025= `
25 - Sample Average Solution - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,596
So without even needing to calculate anything, you can see that we chose the

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:09,200
biggest scores to be in the sample. All the other scores are a lot lower. And

3
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:13,930
so, therefore we automatically know that the average of the sample is going to

4
00:00:13,942 --> 00:00:18,079
be bigger than the population parameter. So this is just an example where

5
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:23,362
sometimes we'll take a sample, and it won't accurately estimate the population

6
00:00:23,374 --> 00:00:24,053

26 - Better Sample - lang_en_vs5.srt

00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,145
So now we're going to have another quiz. What will make the sample statistic, x

2
00:00:06,157 --> 00:00:12,353
bar, closer to the population parameter mu? A smaller sample or a bigger sample?

3
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:13,798
What do you think?

`;
var srt027= `
27 - Better Sample Solution - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,851
So the answer is a bigger sample. If we chose this one also, and let's say these

2
00:00:05,863 --> 00:00:11,425
two, so we double our sample size. Then you see we have this small value 32%.

3
00:00:11,546 --> 00:00:17,142
And that's going to drag down the sample statistic X bar, the average. So, this

4
00:00:17,154 --> 00:00:22,600
will be closer to the population average mu. And of course, ideally, we'd want

5
00:00:22,612 --> 00:00:27,455
the entire population, but often times that's really hard to do, because the

6
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:32,290
population might be so big. That's when we need a sample. But a bigger sample

7
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:37,465
will better approximate the population parameter. Another example where samples

8
00:00:37,477 --> 00:00:42,424
can be misleading is predicting the outcome of the presidential election. For

9
00:00:42,436 --> 00:00:46,970
this last Presidential election with President Obama versus Mitt Romney, a lot

10
00:00:46,982 --> 00:00:51,238
of polls were given out which each came up with its own result. Some of them

11
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,670
predicted that Romney was going to win, which as we know didn't happen. While

12
00:00:55,682 --> 00:01:00,209
each sample may not perfectly predict population parameters. The sample

13
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:05,743
statistic can give us an interval in which the population parameter lies, as

14
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:11,165
long as the sample is random and as unbiased as possible. We'll go more into

15
00:01:11,177 --> 00:01:13,047
depth about samples later.

00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,445
The earliest known academic rating about the meaning of random was by John Venn

2
00:00:04,457 --> 00:00:08,650
in 1888 and his book called the logic of chance. He said, Perhaps the best

3
00:00:08,662 --> 00:00:12,541
typical example that we can give of the scientific meaning of random

4
00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:17,099
distribution is afforded by the arrangement of the drops of rain in a shower. No

5
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:21,430
one can give a guess whereabouts at any instant a drop will fall, but we know

6
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:25,837
that if we put out a sheet of paper it will gradually become uniformly spotted

7
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:30,473
over. And if we were to mark out any two equal areas on the paper, these would

8
00:00:30,485 --> 00:00:34,880
gradually tend to be struck equally often. Therefore, when we have a random

9
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:39,504
sample, each subject has an equal chance of being selected. And then our sample

10
00:00:39,516 --> 00:00:42,111
is more likely to approximate the population.

looked to be about 55. That must correspond

12
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:44,706
to this row here, 556. You can see that hours slept is on the X axis and

13
00:00:44,706 --> 00:00:52,050
temporal memory score is on the Y axis. We call the variable on the X axis

14
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,840
the independent variable or the predictor variable. And we call the variable on

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,970
the Y axis the dependent variable, or

16
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,230
the outcome. We're trying to predict temporal

17
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,780
memory score, using hours slept. Now that

18
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,740
you've sen this data visualized, what can

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,130
we say about the relationship between hours

20
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,540
slept and temporal memory score? This time

21
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,460
this question might be easier to answer.

When we visualize data, it's usually a lot

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,550
easier to draw conclusions. And we can see a

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,260
clear upward trend in the relationship between hours slept

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,740
and temporal memory. Based on this data, we can

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,040
say that in general, the more you sleep

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,450
the better your temporal memory score. This isn't to

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,100
say though that sleep causes a higher temporal memory

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,540
score. This is just the trend that we can

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,320
see from this data. We don't really

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,310
know if a higher temporal memory score translates

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,880
to a better test result. So we can't

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,560
say this second option. This third option is

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,850
the opposite of the relationship we see here.

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,120
And we definitely do see an upward trend

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,540
in this relationship. We'll get more into visualizing

16
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,440

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,274
data comes in all forms. As raw data, or visualized,

18
00:00:58,274 --> 00:01:03,570
or in certain numbers that summarize the data. We should make good

19
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,900
decisions on what methods we should use to draw sound conclusions from our data.

No, this is not necessarily true. Look at these 2 people. They slept different

2
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:12,128
amounts of sleep, 6 hours and 8 hours but got the same temporal memory score

3
00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:13,037
about 70.

4
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:19,351
Remember our discussion of lurking variables or extraneous factors? We haven't

5
00:00:19,363 --> 00:00:24,624
taken all of these into account. In other words, we haven't controlled for

6
00:00:24,636 --> 00:00:30,134
lurking variables. Sleep could influence memory, and by this trend, it looks

7
00:00:30,146 --> 00:00:35,669
like it probably does. But, many other factors can also influence memory, and

8
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:41,164
this varies by person. There's a relationship here between hours slept and

9
00:00:41,176 --> 00:00:46,779
temporal memory score, but that doesn't mean that hours slept causes a higher

10
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:52,369
temporal memory score. In other words, correlation does not prove causation.

Now this is a really important concept, and we're going to try to drive this

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:09,080
point home. Thomas Friedman said in his book, The Lexus and the Olive Tree, that

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:13,395
no two countries with a McDonald's have ever gone to war since opening the

4
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:17,855
McDonald's. This is called the Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention.

5
00:00:17,957 --> 00:00:22,850
Let's just assume that after hearing Thomas Friedman's observation Policy makers

6
00:00:22,862 --> 00:00:27,725
concluded that if every country built at least one McDonald's, we would attain

7
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:32,320
world peace. Well, what could be a plausible explanation for Friedman's

8
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:37,265
observation, and which would lend for different policy conclusions? Let's ask

that really true? &gt;&gt; It's true.

9
00:00:28,636 --> 00:00:32,415
&gt;&gt; Nobody had heard of the golden arches theory of conflict prevention before,

10
00:00:32,427 --> 00:00:36,130
but I put them on the spot and asked them for a possible explanation. Why do you

11
00:00:36,142 --> 00:00:40,482
think that is? &gt;&gt; Because that good food, tastes good. &gt;&gt; Globalization of the

12
00:00:40,494 --> 00:00:44,427
economy. &gt;&gt; Once you have a McDonald's in your country, your motivation just

13
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:49,247
goes way down. &gt;&gt; To have a McDonald's you've reached a certain status, I guess.

14
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:52,670
, And that makes you more first world. I don't know.

15
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,741
&gt;&gt; Maybe countries that bring in McDonald's accept Americans a little more

16
00:00:56,753 --> 00:00:58,551
freely. &gt;&gt; I don't know.

17
00:00:58,551 --> 00:01:02,494
&gt;&gt; This correlation between McDonald's and peace can only lead to some

18
00:01:02,506 --> 00:01:07,103
interesting policy conclusions. So I asked another question. &gt;&gt; So do you think

19
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:13,156
that if every country in the world had a McDonald's, there'd be world peace? &gt;&gt;

20
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,896
Absolutely not.

21
00:01:14,896 --> 00:01:20,313
&gt;&gt; I don't think so because there's different, different, different ways that

22
00:01:20,325 --> 00:01:25,968
everybody think. I wish everybody agreed to do it, but I don't think so. &gt;&gt; I'm

23
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:31,671
skeptical that it's true, actually. &gt;&gt; It's called the golden arches theory of

24
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:34,645
conflict resolution. &gt;&gt; Okay.

25
00:01:34,645 --> 00:01:40,782
&gt;&gt; Correlation does not mean causation, so. &gt;&gt; Words of wisdom. &gt;&gt;, &gt;&gt; That

26
00:01:40,794 --> 00:01:45,294
would be nice wouldn't it? &gt;&gt; Guess I'd go to McDonald's to get that Big Mac,

27
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:49,645
that smile on your face. You don't have to about anything. &gt;&gt; Mcdonald's

28
00:01:49,657 --> 00:01:54,028
originated here, right? So, I mean , I just don't think it's in their best

29
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,684
interest to be putting up McDonalds's in places that they're at war with. &gt;&gt; I

30
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,018
mean, that, the, it stretched too far. There's way to correlate that data. &gt;&gt; I

31
00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:06,377
think there probably is something more driving the conflict than not having a

McDonald's makes people happy, for one thing, and even if it does, many other

3
00:00:09,062 --> 00:00:13,426
factors could make people unhappy again. For this one, I'm thinking that

4
00:00:13,438 --> 00:00:18,142
countries that have McDonald's tend to be more economically developed. And

5
00:00:18,154 --> 00:00:22,386
therefore have more money, so it's implausible they wouldn't be able to afford

6
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:26,637
to go to war. That's my own hunch, but I'm pretty sure this is implausible. For

7
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:30,872
this one, we don't know anything about how many people eat at McDonalds and how

8
00:00:30,884 --> 00:00:35,166
often, and we don't even know for sure if eating McDonalds would make people too

9
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:39,942
unhealthy to engage in a war. This one seems to be the most plausible option.

10
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:44,644
Countries with McDonald's are more open to globalization, and less inclined to

11
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:49,151
go to war. But I have to admit, that would be pretty awesome if we could obtain

12
00:00:49,163 --> 00:00:53,800
world peace just by building a McDonald's in every country. If that were true, I

doing, say, a controlled experiment. They're also relatively inexpensive. They

4
00:00:14,651 --> 00:00:19,188
mostly just require time to implement, and for the respondents to write their

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,307
answers. Surveys can also be conducted remotely. You might have gotten a survey

6

00:00:10,373 --> 00:00:15,164
give the truth for some reason. It's probably a psychological thing, and

4
00:00:15,176 --> 00:00:20,494
oftentimes, without realizing it, we give biased answers. Everyone has their own

5
00:00:20,506 --> 00:00:25,250
bias based on where they grew up, the experiences that they went through, their

6
00:00:25,262 --> 00:00:29,865
beliefs and values. When respondents don't understand the questions, we get

7
00:00:29,877 --> 00:00:34,637
what's called response bias. That's why it's very important for those who write

8
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,257
the survey to be very precise in their wording. And finally, some people just

9
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:43,705
refuse to answer, they don't feel comfortable answering that or they're

10
00:00:43,717 --> 00:00:48,593
incapable of doing so. There might be a certain group of people who don't answer

11
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:52,998
the questions, and therefore, the data that we get from the survey doesn't

12
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,879
accurately represent them. When certain people refuse to answer, this is called

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,530
non-response bias. Remember when we talked about contructs? Surveys are often

14
00:01:03,542 --> 00:01:08,907
used to analyze constructs. And like I told you, I analyzed the construct

15
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:14,776
effort. As you've seen, there isn't just one definition of a construct, there

16
00:01:14,788 --> 00:01:19,785
are many. Therefore, it's crucial to use as subjective measurements as possible.

17
00:01:19,887 --> 00:01:23,310
Surveys really have to be carefully thought out and worded.

Besides surveys controlled experiments are another important type of research.

2
00:00:05,117 --> 00:00:09,885
Imagine that the researchers are testing the effects of some sleep medication on

3
00:00:09,897 --> 00:00:14,835
a bunch of different people and that these people are random sample. This is as

4
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:19,690
oppose to the convenient sample in which people who are convenient to find are

5
00:00:19,702 --> 00:00:24,677
used in the study. Everyone receives a pill, but for some, the pill has

6
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:30,241
medication that supposedly helps you sleep, and for others it's inactive. The

7
00:00:30,253 --> 00:00:35,855
pill looks the same for everybody, and the sample is randomly assigned to one of

8
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:41,361
the two types of pills. What do you think the purpose was for giving some of the

9
00:00:41,373 --> 00:00:46,343
people in inactive pill? To make sure there are no side effects of the active

10
00:00:46,355 --> 00:00:51,140
pill, to have a comparison group to those who took the active pill or to see if

11
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:55,674
the inactive pill can help people sleep.Which do you think the purpose was?

`;
var srt043= `
43 - Placebo Solution - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,426
This answer choice is correct. There are 2 groups of people, and so that way

2
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:09,239
researchers can compare how well the active pill helped people sleep compared to

3
00:00:09,251 --> 00:00:13,945
the inactive pill. In this particular experiment, we can't really test for side

4
00:00:13,957 --> 00:00:18,228
effects of the active pill, and also in this experiment, researchers aren't

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,431
really concerned if the inactive pill can help people sleep. To figure this out

6
00:00:22,443 --> 00:00:26,493
they would have to compare the effects of the inactive pill to something else.

7
00:00:26,588 --> 00:00:30,630
But the purpose is to find out how well the active pill will help people sleep.

var srt044= `
44 - Blind - lang_en_vs5.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,479
Furthermore, participants are not told whether or not they received the active

2
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:08,897
pill or the inactive pill. Why do you think this is? Is it because deception is

3
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:13,277
important in all good research because they may not participate if they knew

4
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:17,558
they were receiving a drug? To make them all believe that they are receiving

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,938
medication? Or they may not participate if they knew they weren't receiving a

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:22,211
drug?

`;
var srt045= `
45 - Blind Solution - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,933
The researchers want all participants to believe that they're taking the

2
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:07,900
medication. This prevents participants from being biased concerning the

3
00:00:07,912 --> 00:00:11,706
effectiveness of the drug. If they all believe that they're taking the

4
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:16,043
medication, then we're controlling for this bias. Not letting the participants

5
00:00:16,055 --> 00:00:20,346
know which treatment they received is called blinding. Researchers use these

6
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:24,751
techniques when they suspect that knowing which treatment you're receiving might

7
00:00:24,763 --> 00:00:28,818
influence your behavior. The inactive pill in this case is called a placebo.

8
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:33,146
Placebos are fake treatments so that the control group is unaware that they are

9
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:37,188
being treated differently. When I say they're treated differently, I mean

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,711
they're not receiving the medication The researcher's didn't tell the

11
00:00:41,723 --> 00:00:46,023
participants which pill they received, because of something called the placebo

12
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:50,242
effect. People who know they're taking a placebo, might subconsciously think

13
00:00:50,254 --> 00:00:54,545
that the placebo's not doing anything. And this will influence the results when

14
00:00:54,557 --> 00:00:59,221
they report how well they slept. Getting back to the quiz answers. This first

15
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:04,170
option is untrue. Researchers only use deception when they suspect that knowing

16
00:01:04,182 --> 00:01:08,872
the actual intent of a study may influence the participants behavior. And in

17
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:13,395
that case information is kept hidden until the end of the study. These two

18
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,833
options are also not true. Participants in experiments need to provide their

19
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:21,910
informed consent before the research can expose them to any treatment. Letting

20
00:01:21,922 --> 00:01:25,645
participants know that they may end up in the control group is part of the

21

informed consent

46 - Double Blind - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,479
To continue with our story, these participants are randomly assigned to either

2
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:08,946
the control group, where they take the placebo pill, or the experimental group,

3
00:00:09,045 --> 00:00:13,414
where they take the active pill. They take the pill at the same time of day, on

4
00:00:13,426 --> 00:00:17,634
the same day, and the same place. And then, they all go to bed in a sleep lab at

5
00:00:17,646 --> 00:00:22,545
the same time. While sleeping, researchers observe the particpant's sleep

6
00:00:22,557 --> 00:00:27,680
patterns and rate their quality of sleep. Do you think these researchers should

7
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:32,604
or should not know which treatment participants received? Why or why not? Yes,

8
00:00:32,712 --> 00:00:37,945
because their ratings will depend on which treatment the people received. No, to

9
00:00:37,957 --> 00:00:43,190
help maintain participant confidentiality. Yes, because the researchers ratings

10
00:00:43,202 --> 00:00:47,955
will be more accurate. Or no, because if they know, their judgements may be

11
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:47,967
biased. What do you think?

`;
var srt047= `
47 - Double Blind Solution - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,010
In this case, it's better if researchers do not know which treatment the

2
00:00:04,022 --> 00:00:08,605
participants received. This is called a double blind experiment, because neither

3
00:00:08,617 --> 00:00:12,906
the participants nor the researchers studying them know which treatment they

4
00:00:12,918 --> 00:00:17,013
received. Single blind is when only the participants are unaware of their

5
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:21,556
treatment condition. And the reason this experiment is double blind is because

6
00:00:21,568 --> 00:00:25,973
if the researcher knows which treatment each person received, that may impact

7
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:30,316
their judgements on how well the active pill works versus the Placebo. It may

8
00:00:30,328 --> 00:00:34,522
subconsciously cause the researchers to think that the people who took the

9
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:38,827
active pill are sleeping better, and this might consciously or unconsciously

10
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,266
alter their measurements.

all the factors we controlled for in this experiment? You may have to replay a

var srt049= `
49 - Controlled Factors Solution - lang_en_vs5.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,659
We controlled for the time at which participants took the pill, the place at

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:09,028
which they slept, because they all slept in the sleep lab, and what the pill

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,693
looks like? It looks the same for both the active and the placebo. We did not

4
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:18,343
however control for gender and age. We can, however, minimize the impact of

5
00:00:18,355 --> 00:00:23,124
these variables on the results. Let me elaborate on this a little bit. Let's say

6
00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:27,921
that only females were assigned to the active pill. And only males were assigned

7
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:32,661
to the inactive pill. Then, if people who took the active pill slept better. We

8
00:00:32,673 --> 00:00:37,354
wouldn't know if it was due to the medication in the pill or maybe women just

9
00:00:37,366 --> 00:00:42,421
sleep better than men. In this particular experiment, we are not controlling for

10
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:47,231
these demographic variables, but we can minimize their impact on our results

11
00:00:47,243 --> 00:00:48,893
through random assignment.

`;
var srt050= `
50 - Random Assignment - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,524
This is why participants should be randomly assigned to treatment, meaning

2
00:00:04,536 --> 00:00:09,164
everyone has an equal chance of being assigned to either of the two treatments.

3
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:14,052
In theory, randomization makes the two groups similar. On average, for example,

4
00:00:14,155 --> 00:00:18,635
the groups should be similar in age, the number of males and females, their

5
00:00:18,647 --> 00:00:23,245
sleep habits, et cetera. And that's why it's good to have a big sample size.

6
00:00:23,347 --> 00:00:28,040
Randomization works best with larger groups. We'll come back to the benefits of

7
00:00:28,052 --> 00:00:32,665
larger samples later in this class. Now one more thing before we end this story.

8
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:37,174
We started this module with the question, If you're preparing for your exam

9
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:41,261
tomorrow, should you stay up studying or should you go to sleep? Researchers

10
00:00:41,273 --> 00:00:45,596
have demonstrated using both observational and experimental studies, that sleep

11
00:00:45,608 --> 00:00:49,741
is important for memory. Getting a good night's sleep will likely pay off more

12
00:00:49,753 --> 00:00:53,980
than a couple of extra hours of studying. On the right you'll find a link to an

13
00:00:53,992 --> 00:00:57,870
interesting story, of you'd like to learn more about this topic. I wish I had

You may have already thought of this, but another thing we could do is two

2
00:00:04,252 --> 00:00:08,800
memory tests on each person, one where they don't get much sleep, and one where

3
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:13,296
they get a lot of sleep. Then we can compare the results between each person's

4
00:00:13,308 --> 00:00:18,220
test. If we did this, what would we be controlling for? Would we be controlling

5
00:00:18,232 --> 00:00:23,495
for differences in memory capabilities due to gender, or differing amounts of

6
00:00:23,507 --> 00:00:28,570
sleep amongst individuals? Or the variation in people's individual memory

7
00:00:28,582 --> 00:00:33,095
capabilities? Or time of day at which subjects took the memory test?

We're not controlling for differences in memory capabilities due to gender in

2
00:00:04,998 --> 00:00:09,717
this particular test. To do this, we could divide the group into males and

3
00:00:09,729 --> 00:00:14,565
females, and then see how sleep influences memory in both groups. We want the

4
00:00:14,577 --> 00:00:20,052
amount of sleep to vary amongst individuals, so that we can see how their memory

5
00:00:20,064 --> 00:00:25,433
is related to that. We are controlling for variation in people's individual

6
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:30,735
memory capabilities,, because by using this same person twice, we're doing

7
00:00:30,747 --> 00:00:36,324
what's called a within-subject design. That way we can see how sleep influences

8
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:41,780
memory for this same person. And by using this same person twice, we're keeping

9
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:46,795
a lot of other things constant, including this variation in people's individual

10
00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:51,555
memory capabilities. We're also not controlling for the time of day in this

11
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:56,440
study, but this would be a good thing to add on to the within-subject study. We

12
00:00:56,452 --> 00:01:01,205
could tell our subjects to sleep a lot, then take the memory test at the same

13
00:01:01,217 --> 00:01:06,292
time the next day as everyone else, like 3 o'clock. Then again, we can tell

14
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:11,530
people to sleep a little, and then take the memory test at the same time of day,

15
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:12,871
again at 3 o'clock.

54 - Katie's Hand Solution - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,365
For the answer, we decided on a certain interval in which my height is feasible.

2
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:08,497
If you guessed within this interval, congratulations. It seems like you

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,858
understand the pattern shown in the scatter plot pretty well.

55 - Draw Conclusions - lang_en_vs3.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,990
What conclusions can we draw from this data, combined with knowing how long my

2
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:09,654
hand is? If I want to be taller, I should let my nails grow longer. Taller

3
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:14,765
people have longer hands. There's no way I'm taller than 7 feet. People who have

4
00:00:14,777 --> 00:00:16,690
longer hands tend to be taller.

56 - Draw Conclusions Solution - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,559
Well, this first one doesn't work. It's not really feasible, because your nails

2
00:00:05,571 --> 00:00:10,964
grow independent of how long your hand is. We also can't assert this second one.

3
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:16,521
We can't simply say that taller people have longer hands. In fact, if we look at

4
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:21,965
the data, these two people look like they have about the same height. But they

5
00:00:21,977 --> 00:00:27,815
have very different hand lengths, therefore we can't say with certainty that

6
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:33,580
taller people automatically have longer hands. There's just a trend in that

7
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:39,470
direction. Also if we look at this trend, we see that people that have about my

8
00:00:39,482 --> 00:00:45,789
hand length, which is 6.75. Tend to have heights around this area. Seven feet is

9
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:51,934
84 inches, which is way up here. Therefore, it's very unlikely that I'm taller

10
00:00:51,946 --> 00:00:58,318
than 7 feet. But I could be. Remember, this relationship shows a correlation,

11
00:00:58,443 --> 00:01:04,190
not a causation. therefore we can't draw this conclusion, however we can say

12
00:01:04,202 --> 00:01:08,615
with certainty that people who have longer hands tend to be taller
